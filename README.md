Hi, I’m @skeripting. My online handle is script_ing. I don't really use this platform often, but you can find my portfolio here: https://github.com/skeripting/skeripting/blob/main/portfolio.md

I began coding in Roblox Lua since I was a 12 year old kid in 2016.

From there, I began branching towards other languages, like C++ and Python.

I’ve coded in React JS and PHP for 2 years as well.

Now, I make free youtube tutorials, teaching people how to script. Watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ80WbXDJ7ujsMKa1LHtw

I've also published a book on how to script in Roblox for beginners. Check it out: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFD9D3BW

I am constantly learning and improving my skills as a programmer/scripter. Currently reading "Clean Code" and "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"

My highest level of mathematics is Calculus III/Linear Algebra. I love math and love challenges. I love incorporating mathematics into my programs to find unique solutions to problems.
