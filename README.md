## Meet Kushal
Hi, I’m @skeripting. My online handle is script_ing. Please find my portfolio here: https://kushaltimsina.com/experience

I began coding in Roblox Lua since I was a 12 year old kid in 2016. I've been scripting Roblox games for 9 years.

My most recent game is BattleMania, with 1.6 million + visits: https://www.roblox.com/games/14945130763/BattleMania

I’ve coded in React JS and PHP for 2+ years as well. I built https://quizzynow.com to help 800+ registered students to improve their test scores.

Now, I make free youtube tutorials, teaching people how to script, to over 1 million+ views. Watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ80WbXDJ7ujsMKa1LHtw

I also write free computer science and Roblox development tutorials on my blog, https://kushaltimsina.com/blog

I've also published a book on how to script in Roblox for beginners. Check it out: https://kushaltimsina.com/book

I am constantly learning and improving my skills as a programmer/scripter. 

My highest level of mathematics is Machine Learning/Linear Algebra/Calculus III. I love math and love challenges. I love incorporating mathematics into my programs to find unique solutions to problems.
