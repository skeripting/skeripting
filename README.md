- 👋 Hi, I’m @skeripting. I go by script_ing. I don't really use this platform often, but you can find my portfolio here: https://github.com/skeripting/skeripting/blob/main/portfolio.md
- 👀 I began coding in Roblox Lua since I was a 12 year old kid in 2016.
- From there, I began branching towards other languages, like C++ and Python.
- I’ve coded in React JS and PHP for 2 years as well.
- 🎮 Now, I make free youtube tutorials, teaching people how to script. Watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ80WbXDJ7ujsMKa1LHtw
- 📖 I've also published a book on how to script in Roblox for beginners. Check it out: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFD9D3BW
- 🌱 I am constantly learning and improving my skills as a programmer/scripter. Currently reading "Clean Code" and "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"
- 🧮 My highest level of mathematics is Calculus III/Linear Algebra. I love math and love challenges. I love incorporating mathematics into my programs to find unique solutions to problems.
