## Meet Kushal
Hi, Iâ€™m @skeripting. 
My online handle is script_ing. 
Please find my full portfolio here: https://kushaltimsina.com/experience

I began coding in Roblox Lua since I was a 12 year old kid in 2016. I've been scripting Roblox games for 9 years. I'm known as the guy that works on games for years and never releases them because I'm obsessed with quality. Some of the games I never released: Elemental Adventures (2019-2021), Pokemon Creation of Zygarde (2018). I finally did release a game, and man, that was a long streak I broke: My game BattleMania has been played 1.7 million + with 30k+ MAU: https://www.roblox.com/games/14945130763/BattleMania

I've coded in React JS and PHP for 2+ years as well. 

I built https://quizzynow.com to help 800+ registered students to improve their test scores using active recall and spaced repetition. My portfolio website, https://kushaltimsina.com is also built in React.

Now, I make free youtube tutorials, teaching people how to script in Roblox, to over 1 million total views and 100,000+ monthly active viewers. Watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ80WbXDJ7ujsMKa1LHtw

People that watch my videos say that I have an amazing way of communicating ideas and teaching in general.

So, I also write free computer science and Roblox development tutorials to 1.7K+ monthly readers on my blog, https://kushaltimsina.com/blog

And, to maximize my teaching impact, I compacted some of my knowledge and published a book on how to script in Roblox for beginners. The 280 page book has had 11,000+ pages of the Amazon Kindle E-Book read across the globe and dozens of sales. Check it out: https://kushaltimsina.com/book

I am constantly learning and improving my skills as a programmer/scripter. My highest level of mathematics is Machine Learning/Linear Algebra/Calculus III. I love math and love challenges. I love incorporating mathematics into my programs to find unique solutions to problems.
