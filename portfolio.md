# Portflio
Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. In this file, I'll try to briefly communicate my work over the years. 
This is by no means a comprehensive portfolio. Just some really recent stuff.

## YouTube 
I've been teaching scripting on Roblox since 2016. Please feel free to look through my recent tutorials. https://m.youtube.com/c/Scripting

## Battlemania (August 2023-present)
I'm currently working on a game similar to Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. 
You can see some showcases here: https://twitter.com/i/status/1710776544577061138

## LEVGRU Gun System (Nov 2021-present) 
This is a gun system for a commission that I was hired for involving a shooter game, which is very difficult to script due to its complex nature, but I've enjoyed it lots.

I am comfortable learning new styles of programming as per my clients' needs and extending outside of roblox to fulfill their goals
I usually make my own frameworks and rely on object-oriented programming, but can work with anything you need
