Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I mainly do Roblox Lua, React JS, SCSS, and PHP.

In this file, I'll try to briefly communicate my work over the years. 
This is by no means a comprehensive portfolio. Just some really recent stuff.

## LEVGRU Gun System (Nov 2021-present) 
This is a gun system for a commission that I was hired for involving a shooter game on Roblox, which is very difficult to script due to its complex nature, but I've enjoyed it lots.

## Pokemon: Creation of Zygarde (2017-18) 
This was an unreleased project (since Nintendo began to DMCA Roblox Pokemon games at around this time) that I was working on. At the time, Roblox didn't support bones or blender animations, so we had to find a creative workaround, which I coded. You can see some of the move animations here:

### Small Obfuscator 
In 8th grade, I made this really simple script obfuscator in under an hour dumping strings from lua scripts and obfuscating variable names and the like.

## Dragon Ball: Ultimate Power (2016)
This was my first game on Roblox. I really enjoyed dragon ball at the time, so I learned a lot about 3D game development, math, and scripting by making this game. I was about 12 years old.

I am comfortable learning new styles of programming as per my clients' needs and extending outside of roblox to fulfill their goals
I usually make my own frameworks and rely on object-oriented programming, but can work with anything you need.
Looking forward to working with you!
