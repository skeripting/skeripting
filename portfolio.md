# Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. In this file, I'll try to briefly communicate my work over the years. 
This is by no means a comprehensive portfolio. Just some really recent stuff.

## YouTube 
I've been teaching scripting on Roblox since 2016. Please feel free to look through my recent tutorials. https://m.youtube.com/c/Scripting

## Battlemania (August 2023-present)
I'm currently working on a game similar to Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. 
You can see some showcases here: https://twitter.com/i/status/1710776544577061138

## LEVGRU Gun System (Nov 2021-present) 
This is a gun system for a commission that I was hired for involving a shooter game, which is very difficult to script due to its complex nature, but I've enjoyed it lots.

## Elemental Adventures (August 2020-2022) (on hiatus)
My main project for 2 years was a game called Elemental Adventures (now on hiatus).

## Pokemon: Creation of Zygarde (2017-18) 
This was an unreleased project (since Nintendo began to DMCA Roblox Pokemon games at around this time) that I was working on. At the time, Roblox didn't support bones or blender animations, so we had to find a creative workaround, which I coded. You can see some of the move animations here:

I am comfortable learning new styles of programming as per my clients' needs and extending outside of roblox to fulfill their goals
I usually make my own frameworks and rely on object-oriented programming, but can work with anything you need
